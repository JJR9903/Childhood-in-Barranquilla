# Childhood in Barranquilla and Top 13 Colombian Cities

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring childhood conditions, educational outcomes, and early childhood development across Barranquilla and Colombia's top 13 cities.

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains data cleaning and analysis workflows focused on understanding childhood experiences, educational quality, and early childhood development indicators in Barranquilla and selected Colombian cities. The project examines education statistics, standardized test performance (ICFES), and early childhood enrollment data from official Colombian government sources.

**Key Research Focus:**
- Educational access and outcomes across regions
- Early childhood development indicators
- Educational equity analysis
- Comparative analysis between Barranquilla and other major Colombian cities

> **Project Status:**  
> **Completed July 2023** (no further development or updates are planned)
